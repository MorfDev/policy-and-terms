Last updated: February 27, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service.
This Privacy Policy refers to all Freshworks applications on Freshworks Marketplace provided by MorfDev.

Applications hosted on Freshworks Marketplace by MorfDev are Third-Party Services for Freshworks.
By installing the application, the client agrees to study and comply with the Freshworks rules (https://www.freshworks.com/terms/).

MorfDev is committed to providing technical support for its applications. Applications are updated according to Freshworks policies and must be reviewed, 
which takes about 7 days.

What data do we collect:
1) Url to your store.
2) Data required to connect to the store via the REST API or through our extensions.
This data is stored by Freshworks and their storage and security practices are used.

The store url and token (or similar data for REST API) are required to display information about your customers and their orders on the Freshworks side.
Our applications do not save data about your customers and their orders, and do not provide this data to third-party services (except Freshworks).
For details on how Freshworks may use your personal data, see https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/
